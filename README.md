# 📚 VCCA — Architecture Documentation

> **Welcome!** 👋
> This documentation covers **Vertical Cleaner Clean Architecture (VCCA)** — the architectural pattern used across our projects. It will walk you through how a VCCA-structured system is built, from the big picture down to the nitty-gritty. Don't worry if you're new to these concepts; everything is explained step by step.

## 🧱 Tech Stack at a Glance

```
Language:      C# / .NET 8
Frontend:      Blazor Server
UI Components: Radzen
Database:      Microsoft SQL Server (EF Core + Dapper)
Mediator:      MediatR
Mapping:       Mapster
Guards:        Ardalis.Guards
Auth:          Cookie Authentication (Claims-based)
External:      SAP via B1SLayer
```

## 💡 The #1 Rule

> **Every layer has a job. Don't skip layers.**

A user clicks a button → the UI talks to a Web Repository → which calls a Web Handler → which sends a MediatR message → which the Application layer handles → which calls the database.

This chain always stays intact. You'll see it everywhere in this documentation.

## 📍 To Do

> **There is always room for improvement.**

This architecture is still a work in progress. There are [Architectural Debts](.docs/99-architectural-debts.md) that need to be reviewed and addressed.

Some key things we are planning to add:
- **Web API support** – so we can expose backend functionality through HTTP endpoints.
- **Headless setup** – allowing JavaScript frontends (like React or Angular) to connect to a C# API.
